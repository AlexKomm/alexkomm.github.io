Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I'm trying not to, kid. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. There's nothing for me here.</p>

Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. Acid lysine. Unless they're.</p>
